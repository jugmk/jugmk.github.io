  title: "How to become a great developer"
  abstract: >
    At the core, the job of a software developer is and has always been
            the same: writing good, elegant, sustainable and bug-free software
            that exceeds the expectations of your clients. But the context in
            which we do our job is changing and with it the skills required to be
            a great software developer.
            In this talk, I want to go through a couple of things that I think
            make the difference between a developer and a great developer. This
            includes some technical skills and practices, but also non-technical
            things that you might not consider relevant for a developer at first.

  title: "Caching – oldie but goldie"
  abstract: >
    When we deal with performance issues one of the classical approaches is to use a cache, but using
        caching doesn't imply an one size fits all solution. We will discuss about different elements we have to
        consider when we design our cache solution and analyze some real life scenarios.

    We take a look at Amazon Web Services’ Elastic Compute Cloud (AWS EC2)
        service as a representative of the IaaS family to check its shortcomings during the resource provisioning
        and configuration process in particular for solutions that need to scale. We then take look at the AWS OpsWorks
        service that promises to eliminate those shortcomings without sacrificing the control and flexibility that
        IaaS provides.

  title: "IDE independent development with JBoss Forge"
  abstract: >
    Java EE has long been accused for being very hard to quickly develop web applications and most of the
            accusations come from the old J2EE days. It was the times when you had to create heavy deployment
            descriptors
            even for the simplest app. So every vendor provided plethora of deployment and development tools. With Java
            EE 5
            and 6 the things got simplified a lot with the removal of accompanying descriptor XMLs and imposing the
            convention over configuration development model. But still there are some things that make developer's life
            hard: finding the right dependencies, setting up ORM layer, writing all the plumbing CRUD code.
    In this session we'll introduce JBoss Forge - a tool that further simplifies developer experience. Even though
        it's not bound to Java EE, we'll show how you can easily wire JPA, bean validation, JAX-RS, EJB. Another cool
        feature of the tool is its IDE agnostics: all its features can be used transparently from Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA
        and (coming soon) from NetBeans, as well as from the command line.
        Come and see how Java [EE] can feel like all the *rails frameworks that are threatening to kill it!

  title: "Rapid Development of High Performance Web Apps with Rapidoid "
  abstract: >
    Serving millions of HTTP requests per second is now really easy - simply implement a web handler with a
            single line of Java code and use the Rapidoid framework to do the rest and the REST. Rapidoid is a new
            open-source framework providing simplicity of modern web development. It can be used to write any kind of
            asynchronous high-performance TCP/IP servers, and is built on top of low-level Java NIO. It features very
            fast HTTP server written from scratch for maximum performance, a framework for POJO-based RESTful services
            and complex web applications, off-heap buffers and minimal usage of the Java heap, minimalistic dependency
            injection and many cool static utilities. It integrates well with OhmDB and it is released under the APL.

    How can we start writing immutable and declarative code? How can we focus on the what, not the how? In this
        session we shall discuss the functional programming in java. This talk will also mention higher-order functions
        and how we can leverage lazy evaluation and composition of lambda expressions. A demo will present predicates,
        selectors and functions in a new way and will show how to inject dependencies. An explanation will be presented
        on how we can mix object composition with function composition. Last but not least some time will be spent on
        parallelising operations with composition of lambda expressions.

  title: "Modern Web Application Development Workflow "
  abstract: >
     As we all know, development of web application, especially frontend, has changed a lot over past few
            years. The JavaScript community has grown and people started using it the right way, as it was supposed
            to.
            Today, development of web apps always starts, and is dependent on choosing the right frameworks,
            build system, package manager, etc...
            There is a lot of options and to find the right one for your project is a true art itself.
            My topic for the presentation would be creating environment for the frontend part of the project,
            which includes a build system (Grunt), dependency management (Bower), JS frameworks (KnockoutJS
            and jQuery), CSS tools and preprocesors (SASS), linting tool (JSHint) and Testing tools and frameworks
            (Karma and Jasmine). The end result of the presentation will be ToDo application which will follow the principles shown in
            the presentation. I will also mention other technologies like Angular, Gulp, JSLint etc. but I will not
            cover them as extensively as previously mentioned technologies.
