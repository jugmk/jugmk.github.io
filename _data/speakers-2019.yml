  title: "A deterministic way to run and test your applications with Testcontainers"
  abstract: >
    <p>Gone are the days when your application consisted of just a web server and a database. The complexity of today’s applications is such that they need to persist their data in a variety of database stores (MongoDB, Cassandra), provide full text search capabilities (Elasticsearch), speak to other applications (RabbitMQ, Kafka) or simply interact with a third-party system over REST.</p>
    <p>Setting up your local and CI environment with all these infrastructure services can be quite the challenge. Starting with the tedious process of manual setup, keeping the documentation up to date, OS and product version differences (“works on my machine” anyone?), the list of potential problems goes on and on.</p>
    <p>Once we venture into integration testing, a different set of problems arise. Running your JPA queries against an H2 in-memory database is well supported but how do you make sure that your MongoDB or Elasticsearch queries work?</p>
    <p>Testcontainers provides a deterministic way of running and testing your applications. It automates the environment setup by leveraging Docker so you don’t need to do it manually, and spins up Docker containers for the duration of the integration tests and tears them down once the test execution has finished. Out-of-the-box support is provided for well known RDBMS services (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, etc.), Elasticsearch, Kafka, Webdriver, Localstack, etc but any third-party service can be wired-in by leveraging GenericContainer as base. Complex scenarios are supported through Testcontainer’s integration with Docker Compose.</p>

  title: "Spring and Kotlin, is it a functional relationship?"
  abstract: >
    <p>Spring Framework 5 introduced dedicated Kotlin support to ensure that Spring and Kotlin play well together. One of the key strengths of Kotlin is that it provides a very good interoperability with libraries written in Java. But there are ways to go even further and allow writing fully idiomatic Kotlin code when developing your next Spring application.</p>
    <p>In the presentation I will cover the following:</p>
    <p>- a very brief introduction to Kotlin</p>
    <p>- how to write a minimal Spring Boot application using only Kotlin</p>
    <p>- Kotlin plugins for Spring support</p>
    <p>- JPA and data classes</p>
    <p>- nullability support</p>
    <p>- extension methods and more.</p>
    <p>With many examples of code I will try to show you can write more expressive and functional applications in your favorite framework using the full power of Kotlin.</p>

  title: "JUnit: Revenge of the 5th"
  abstract: >
    JUnit 4 might be considered the standard testing framework in Java, but since its release in 2006 not much has changed, as the framework neglected to provide ways to simplify testing or make it more flexible. Luckily, in 2017, a developer-friendly upgrade - JUnit 5 - was released with its main goals being to be both backwards and forwards compatible. JUnit 5 features include parallel and conditional test execution, tagging, nested tests, dynamic tests, repeated tests, parametrized tests, custom display names and more. Furthermore, with the new JUnit Platform, third-party test engines can be developed for other JVM languages. This presentation walks the audience through the JUnit 5 architecture, highlights the advantages over its predecessor, and covers the way to migrate from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5.

    Across different plastic examples spectators should understand the importance of the UX process. Getting out and talking with clients and potential users is equal important as the development process of the product. The pillars of the project and its intuitive and usability perfection is also based on the UX process. UX is not a profession it is experience gathered with practice and research results. Basically you dont need UI if you understand in total the user needs, habits, daily routine etc.

  title: "Boilerhate - hate for boilerplate "
  abstract: >
    <p>Writing code is not hard. But writing correct code is a challenge. That involves a lot more work than the production of code itself. So we aim to minimize the amount of boilerplate code we write by applying various tools to our work, in order to decrease the time we spend on menial tasks and increase the time spent on business-impacting tasks. Code generation through annotation processor or the java.lang.reflect.Proxy can and does greatly help in achieving this goal.</p>
    <p>The presentation will explore the few ways of code generation in Java, and how Spring's BeanPostProcessor and relatives help in applying the code generation solutions automatically and on an application level. Ever wondered how Spring's @Transactional, @ConfigurationProperties or @Validated are applied? Will cover the ways in which Spring retrofits our code to add functionality on top of it like the mentioned transaction management, bean validation, and how we can use the same approach to develop similar solutions on our own. And will go through the annotation processing way of code generation again with a personal example, and open source projects like QueryDsl, Lombok, Dagger, MapStruct, and others.</p>

In some of those projects, CQRS and Event Sourcing came as a natural solution, but things had to be built from scratch almost every time. Finding out about AxonFramework got him interested in being a part of the solution. In March 2018 he joined AxonIQ team on a mission to build tools and frameworks which would help others in building event-driven, reactive systems.
  title: "Introduction to DDD, CQRS, and EventSourcing with Axon Framework"
  abstract: >
    <p>DDD (Domain-Driven Design) offers a number of valuable architectural guardrails such as bounded contexts, domain events and sets a good base for CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation). If we apply these architectural concepts wisely, they enable us to write a friendly, structured monolith that can be transformed into microservices in a controlled manner. The Axon Framework helps even more by providing a clean, location-transparent, event-driven way of implementing these architectural concepts.</p>
    <p>In this talk, we will zoom in on this DDD/CQRS approach to evolutionary microservices with Axon. As part of the talk, there will be a live coding demo showing Axon in action. Join me to learn from each other new ways of dealing with software complexity!</p>

  title: "OKRs for software engineers: A tool for personal and team growth."

    <p>Many of us are hands-on software engineers and it is often that we face challenges when working in a team or collaborating with few or many people. OKRs are a management tool which can be used from small individual teams to large and cascaded organizations. We will focus on small and nimble teams and even individuals managing themselves. The secret of 1+1 > 2 lies in good collaboration and what other better tool for software developers than one invented by engineers at Intel and pioneered by Google from when they were a 30 person team until today when they're still using it and perfecting it.</p>
    <p>We will go through two interactive examples which are enough for understanding the basics and inspiring oneself to look more closely into OKRs. The advantages of OKRs will be obvious, even for the young audience which hasn't been yet introduced to management methods for better team work.</p>
    <p>OKRs have been implemented in many Silicon Vally startups and other companies under the mentorship of John Doer (who also mentored Google) and have been vastly popularized in the past several years mainly with his book "Measure What Matters".</p>

So, what is wrong? Why are you still struggling with errors and unpredictable expectations? Maybe you think you are not agile enough or maybe there is a missing link in your CI/CD workflow. It is time to talk about Continuous Reliability - the key principle for success with agile. Join this session to tackle challenges and pitfalls in adoption of agile principles through real-life cases. Let’s talk how can the Continuous Reliability principle strengthen the software development process from planning, management execution, development, testing and delivery perspective, aligned to customer and request management, continuous integration, automated tests, and continuous delivery with highest level of stability. All through examples that reflect on team practices and cultural changes.
