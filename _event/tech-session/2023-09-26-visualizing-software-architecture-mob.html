    When it comes to visualizing our system's architecture, there are choices to be made. Do we use UML or another notation? Should we stick to Visio, maybe use Draw.io, or perhaps something else? 
    Where do we store the diagrams, and more importantly, how do we maintain them and keep them up to date?
    We will look at the C4 Model and explore how it helps us describe our system's architecture to different stakeholders using a minimal set of abstractions and a lightweight notation model. 
    In a live demo, we will “write” an architecture model using the Structurizr DSL and generate multiple diagrams automatically.
- title: MOB - Pair programming on steroids

  abstract: >
    Mob Programming is a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer. 
    This extends the concept of pair programming from two people working together to the entire team continuously collaborating at a single computer to deliver a single work item at a time.
